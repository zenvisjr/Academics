## Introduction
ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed based on behavioral symptoms. Traditional methods are often time-consuming and costly. This project aims to address these challenges by building a machine learning pipeline for ADHD classification using phenotypic data.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Visualization of key insights, such as gender distribution and ADHD diagnosis trends.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Decision Tree
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for efficient computation.
- User-friendly interface for inputting custom data and predicting ADHD categories.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
  - Deep Learning: `tensorflow`, `keras`

## Dataset
The project uses the ADHD-200 Phenotypic dataset. Key steps:
1. Data cleaning, including handling missing values and duplicates.
2. Feature selection and preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical data, standardizing numerical features).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
